# CDM-Signalling

The CDM-Signalling module is focusing on the modelling of the signalling subsystem and is part of the work on the [Conceptual Data Model](https://github.com/UICrail/CDM-MOTIONAL/wiki/01-%E2%80%90-What-is-the-CDM%3F) within the FP1-MOTIONAL project (see [CDM-MOTIONAL](https://github.com/UICrail/CDM-MOTIONAL) for more details).

This repository is based on [EULYNX DataPrep 1.2](https://eulynx.eu/resource-hub-dataprep-model/), among others.
